Subject: [PATCH] scsi: sd: Introduce manage_shutdown device flag

Commit aa3998dbeb3a ("ata: libata-scsi: Disable scsi device
manage_system_start_stop") change setting the manage_system_start_stop
flag to false for libata managed disks to enable libata internal
management of disk suspend/resume. However, a side effect of this change
is that on system shutdown, disks are no longer being stopped (set to
standby mode with the heads unloaded). While this is not a critical
issue, this unclean shutdown is not recommended and shows up with
increased smart counters (e.g. the unexpected power loss counter
"Unexpect_Power_Loss_Ct").

This patch resolves this issue by further refining the sd driver
start/stop control of disks using the new flag manage_shutdown. If set
to true, the function sd_shutdown() will issue a START STOP UNIT command
with the start argument set to 0 when a disk is shutdown on system power
off (system_state == SYSTEM_POWER_OFF).
